<h1 align="center">Welcome to my data science website repository üëã</h1>


> This Github repository hold the code (Jupyter Notebooks or Python Scripts) of my website where I wrote article, and tutorials about Data Science in general.

## üß† Context

Hi there, it‚Äôs Dhaif, and welcome to my website repository ! You will find a ton of free ressources that will help you on your coding journey on Data Science and Machine Learning. This repository only hold the code, so make sure to check the related article on my website. 

## üöÄ Usage

This repository is organised by folder, each folder contain the code and a Readme with the link to the corresponding article on my Website. I recommend to use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html), which extend the traditional uses of Jupyter Notebook by adding components such as file navigation, a terminal and so on. It is very flexible and easy to use, and it has a very rich ecosystem of third party extension that allow you to customnize JupyterLab to your need.

Because the notebook I usually propose are organised in section, one particular extension is [Collapsible_Headings](https://github.com/aquirdTurtle/Collapsible_Headings) that allow you to toggle the different section in the notebook.

## ü§ù Contributing

I will check regularly that the code is up to date, but if you spot a issue, feel to make a dedicated pull request, precising the article and your proposed correction in your pull request.
